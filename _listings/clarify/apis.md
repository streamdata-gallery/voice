  more of its interactions, in more and more ways, it needs a new generation of tools
  to filter, manage, and process the raw data. Clarifys API, SDKs and plugins enable
  developers and entrepreneurs to add audio and video search to any application. Clarify
  is already being used by disruptors and innovators, as well as some of the world???s
  largest institutions.
